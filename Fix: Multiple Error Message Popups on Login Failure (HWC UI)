This results in:

Poor user experience

Confusing UI behavior

Redundant error notifications


The issue was caused by duplicate error handling, where:

Error was being handled in the component level (login component)

The same error was also handled in the global HTTP interceptor

This resulted in multiple toast/alert messages being triggered for a single failed API response.
